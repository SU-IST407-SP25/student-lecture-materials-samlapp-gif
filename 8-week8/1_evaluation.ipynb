    "# Evaluation in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical step in an ML workflow is evaluating your model. There are two important considerations when evaluating a classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What measurements to use (these depend on whether we're doing regression or classification)\n",
    "2. How to sample your data for testing \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about both of these things below, but first a brief discussion about the types of errors you can encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Error vs. Generalization Error\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/IST707-Week21.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, evaluating a model's performance involves understanding two key concepts: training error and generalization error. **Training error** refers to the error that the model makes on the training data, the same data it learns from. It's a measure of how well the model fits the training data. However, fitting the training data too closely can lead to overfitting, where the model captures noise along with the underlying data pattern. This is where **generalization error** comes into play. Generalization error measures how well a model performs on unseen data, that is, data not used during the training process. It's an indicator of how well the model has learned to generalize from the training data to broader, unseen instances. A model that performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data (high generalization error) is overfitted, whereas a model that achieves a balance, performing well both on training and unseen data, is considered well-generalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Consider a model trained to predict house prices. If this model is trained on a specific dataset of house prices in a city and achieves very low error rates on this training set, it has a low training error. However, if this model, when used to predict prices of houses in a different city (unseen data), performs poorly, it has a high generalization error. The goal in model development is to minimize both training error and generalization error to create a model that is accurate and robust against unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Types of Measures**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating regression models, three commonly used metrics are R² (R-squared), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). Let's explore these metrics in detail and see how to implement them in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R² (R-squared) Score\n",
    "\n",
    "R², also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It provides an indication of the goodness of fit of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R² ranges from 0 to 1.\n",
    "- An R² of 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the data.\n",
    "- An R² of 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSR}{SST} $$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "SSR is the sum of squared residuals\n",
    "SST is the total sum of squares\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically:\n",
    "$$ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}i)^2}{\\sum{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2} $$\n",

    "##### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- An R² of 0.7 means that 70% of the variance in the target variable can be explained by the model.\n",
    "- Higher R² values indicate a better fit, but be cautious of overfitting when R² is very close to 1.\n"

    "### RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE (which we've discussed before) is a frequently used measure of the differences between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. It represents the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "- RMSE is always non-negative, and a value of 0 indicates a perfect fit to the data.\n",
    "- It has the same units as the dependent variable.\n",

    "#### Formula\n",

    "## Comparing MAE and RMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Both MAE and RMSE are commonly used metrics for regression problems, but they have some key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interpretation**: \n",
    "   - MAE is easier to interpret as it's in the same units as the target variable and represents the average absolute error.\n",
    "   - RMSE is in the same units as the target variable, but it represents the standard deviation of the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity to outliers**:\n",
    "   - MAE is less sensitive to outliers because it doesn't square the errors.\n",
    "   - RMSE gives higher weight to large errors due to the squaring operation, making it more sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mathematical properties**:\n",
    "   - MAE is based on the L1 norm (sum of absolute values).\n",
    "   - RMSE is based on the L2 norm (sum of squared values).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Formula comparison**:\n",
    "   MAE: $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|$\n",
    "   RMSE: $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use cases**:\n",
    "   - MAE is preferred when you want to treat all errors equally.\n",
    "   - RMSE is preferred when large errors are particularly undesirable, as it penalizes them more heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing Between MAE and RMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use MAE when you want to treat all errors equally and when outliers are not particularly problematic for your application.\n",
    "- Use RMSE when large errors are especially undesirable, or when you want to maintain mathematical properties like differentiability (RMSE is differentiable everywhere, while MAE is not differentiable at 0).\n",
    "- Often, it's beneficial to report both metrics to provide a more comprehensive view of your model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the choice between MAE and RMSE (or using both) can depend on your specific problem, the nature of your data, and the requirements of your stakeholders.\n",

    "## **Classification Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** is a commonly used metric in classification problems which calculates the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. It's defined as the number of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) divided by the total number of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, accuracy can be misleading, especially in cases where the dataset is imbalanced, meaning there's a significant difference in the number of instances of the different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of Accuracy\n",
    "1. **Does Not Reflect Class Imbalance**: Accuracy does not take into account the imbalance in the distribution of the classes. In a highly imbalanced dataset, even a naive model predicting only the majority class can yield a high accuracy.\n",
    "2. **No Insight into Type of Errors**: Accuracy does not distinguish between the types of errors (false positives vs. false negatives), which can be critical in certain domains like medical diagnosis or fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Breast Cancer Testing\n",
    "Consider a breast cancer screening test applied to 1000 individuals with an accuracy of 94.5%, and the base rate of breast cancer in this population is 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out of 1000 individuals, 50 (5%) have breast cancer, and 950 (95%) do not.\n",
    "- With an accuracy of 94.5%, the test correctly identifies 945 individuals (both cancer and non-cancer cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down this accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **True Positives (TP)**: These are individuals who have breast cancer and are correctly identified by the test as having it.\n",
    "2. **True Negatives (TN)**: These are individuals who do not have breast cancer and are correctly identified by the test as not having it.\n",
    "3. **False Positives (FP)**: These are individuals who do not have breast cancer but are incorrectly identified by the test as having it.\n",
    "4. **False Negatives (FN)**: These are individuals who have breast cancer but are incorrectly identified by the test as not having it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the accuracy and base rate, we can't directly deduce the exact number of TP, FP, TN, and FN, but we can infer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If all 50 actual cancer cases are correctly identified, then we have 50 TPs. The remaining 895 correct predictions must be TNs (945 correct predictions minus 50 TPs). This would leave 55 incorrect predictions (1000 total minus 945 correct predictions), which would all have to be FPs since all the TPs are accounted for. This scenario implies a very high false positive rate.\n",
    "- Conversely, if some of the cancer cases are missed (FNs), the number of FPs would decrease, but this would increase the FN rate, which is also problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, even with a high accuracy of 94.5%, the low base rate of cancer significantly affects the interpretation of the result. A high number of false positives or false negatives can still occur, which can be critical in a medical context. This example illustrates why accuracy alone, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets, might not be a sufficient metric for evaluating the performance of a diagnostic test. Other metrics like precision, recall, and the F1 score are crucial for a more complete evaluation.\n"

In contrast, for medical diagnostics (where missing a positive diagnosis can be critical), a higher threshold might be chosen to ensure high recall.\n",

Thus, we usually hold some data in reserve (which we call \"held-out\" or \"test\" data), train on the non-test data (called the \"training data\"), and evaluate on the test data.  The gold standard for this is \"cross-validation,\" which performs this process multiple times and then averages scores across the different held-out samples. However, cross-validation is computationally more intensive, and so sometimes we'll use simpler methods (e.g., a single train test split).\n",

In cross-validation, the dataset is divided into multiple smaller sets or \"folds\". The model is then trained and evaluated multiple times, with each fold getting a chance to serve as the test set while the remaining parts are used for training. The most common form of this technique is *k-fold cross-validation*, where the data is split into 'k' number of folds. For each iteration, a different fold is used for testing, and the rest for training. The final performance metric is typically the average of the model's performance across all folds.\n",

It ensures that every data point is used for both training and testing, which makes the evaluation more reliable and less dependent on the particular way the data is split.

    "Stratification is a technique used in data splitting, especially important in classification problems, to ensure that each subset of the data (such as training and testing sets) has a similar distribution of class labels as the original dataset. This is particularly crucial when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one or more classes are underrepresented compared to others.\n",

    "When performing a train-test split without stratification in an imbalanced dataset, there's a risk that the distribution of classes in the training and testing sets will be significantly different from each other and from the original dataset. This can lead to biased or inaccurate models, as the model may not be trained or evaluated on a representative sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratification addresses this issue by dividing the data in a way that maintains the same proportion of each class in both the training and testing sets as found in the original dataset. In Scikit-Learn's `train_test_split` function, this is achieved by setting the `stratify` parameter to the class labels. As a result, stratification leads to more reliable model evaluation and performance metrics, particularly in scenarios of class imbalance.\n",

Data leakage occurs when information from outside your training data inappropriately influences your model during training. A common form of leakage happens when you transform or preprocess your entire dataset before splitting it into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you have a dataset and you want to standardize your features (making them have mean 0 and standard deviation 1). If you standardize the entire dataset first and then split it into training and test sets, you're actually using information from your test data (its mean and standard deviation) to transform your training data. This is leakage because in a real-world scenario, you wouldn't have access to future data when training your model.\n",
